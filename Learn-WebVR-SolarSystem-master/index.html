The name Saturn comes from the Roman god of harvest. \n

            planetinfo="infoposition: 0 0 -1.35; info:Uranus \n Description \n Uranus is a very unique planet because it rotates on it's side. It rotates with a tilt of 97.77 degrees. Some people say it's like that because it was hit by a planet early on it's lifetime. Uranus is one of the two Ice Giant planets in the solar system. Most of it's mass is a hot dense liquid of 'icy' materials, and other materials like water, methane, and ammonia. Uranus also hase rings, but they are very faint. \n

          Interesting Facts \n Uranus does have rings, but they are narrow an dark \n Like Venus it rotates east to west.

          info: Neptune \n Description \n Neptune is the farthest planet from the sun and is one of the two Ice giant planets in the solar system. Neptune also has rings. It has a storm that is similiar to the Great Red Spot in Jupiter called the Great Dark Spot. Neptune has one of the harshest weather with winds up to 1,200 mph. The temperatures go down to -200 degrees Celcius, which is the coldest average temperature in the solar system. Most of Neptune are oceans of ammonia and methane and a surface made of a hot, dense fluid of icy materials. The name Neptune comes from the Roman god of the sea. \n

          Interesting Facts \n Neptune has the coldest average temperature in entire solar system \n Neptune also has rings and is the smallest of all the gas giants in the solar system \n Neptune's Great Dark Spot has actually vanished and now there is another storm called up in Neptune's Northerm hemisphere \n It gets the blue color because it's atmosphere absorbs all the red light, but reflects all the blue light back into space;
